I have strong personal commitments to justice, which I enact through sustained community engagement in my research and personal work. 

With support as a CU Engage Community-Based Research Fellow, I have worked to integrate principles of equity and justice in my research partnerships, particularly in studies of Drag vs AI workshops with local public educators. Working as a team with community educators as co-researchers, we modified workshop materials and are now developing a co-authored paper.  

I have also served in formal community service volunteer roles in both undergraduate and graduate schooling. 

As an undergraduate at the University of Alabama, I planned and led biannual service trips as an Assistant Team Leader at the [Center for Service and Leadership](https://leadandserve.sa.ua.edu/) for two years. 

After I joined CU as a PhD student, I helped to found [United Campus Workers of Colorado](https://www.ucwcolorado.org/), our CU labor union. In 2020, I was elected to the Steering Committee and then elected union secretary, where I served for one year. 

I have also been organizing on a weekly basis for over two years with [SAFE Boulder](https://safeboulder.org/), a direct aid and advocacy group with the houseless community.
