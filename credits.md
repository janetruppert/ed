While pursuing research and education, I have also developed skills in web development, higher education, and technology evaluation. In particular, I have experience developing websites with languages such as PHP, teaching computer science through languages such as Python, and evaluating the accessibility and privacy of technologies according to given metrics.

As a Privacy Policy Evaluator with [Common Sense Media](https://www.commonsensemedia.org/)’s [Privacy Program](https://privacy.commonsense.org/), I perform quantitative evaluations of legal policies and publish qualitative, written summaries to the program’s website. 

During my tenure as a doctoral student, I have taught the undergraduate Python computing course Computational Reasoning I over a number of semesters. In the summer of 2019, I was the course’s primary instructor for 15 graduate and undergraduate students who were completely new to coding. As the instructor, I implemented a project-based curriculum that included interactive game design and data storytelling. 

To design and administer this curriculum, I drew on my experience teaching Python to undergraduates as a graduate teaching assistant for same course, as well as teaching Python to middle school students in a [Girls Who Code club](https://girlswhocode.com/) I co-founded with the [Tuscaloosa Public Library](https://www.tuscaloosa-library.org/).

As an undergraduate in 2017, I joined the University of Alabama’s brand-new [Technology Accessibility Initiative](https://accessibility.ua.edu/) as an accessibility evaluator. As part of this ambitious project to audit and and improve the accessibility of university websites according to [WCAG 2.0 guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/), I personally performed over 100 manual and automated accessibility audits and organized resources to track our group’s progress. 

This led me to subsequent opportunities through the University of Alabama’s [Office of Information Technology](https://oit.ua.edu/), where I was hired as a student web developer by their Office of Multimedia Services to design and update websites and later by [Housing and Residential Communities](https://housing.sa.ua.edu/) on a special project to develop a work order submission form. To develop this updated form, I implemented Laravel, PHP, and XAMPP database tools and managed the project end-to-end.
