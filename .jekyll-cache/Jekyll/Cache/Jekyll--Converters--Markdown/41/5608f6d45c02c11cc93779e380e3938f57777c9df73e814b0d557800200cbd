<p>I have strong personal commitments to justice, which I enact through sustained community engagement in my research and personal work.</p>

<p>With support as a CU Engage Community-Based Research Fellow, I have worked to integrate principles of equity and justice in my research partnerships, particularly in studies of Drag vs AI workshops with local public educators. Working as a team with community educators as co-researchers, we modified workshop materials and are now developing a co-authored paper.</p>

<p>I have also served in formal community service volunteer roles in both undergraduate and graduate schooling.</p>

<p>As an undergraduate at the University of Alabama, I planned and led biannual service trips as an Assistant Team Leader at the <a href="https://leadandserve.sa.ua.edu/">Center for Service and Leadership</a> for two years.</p>

<p>After I joined CU as a PhD student, I helped to found <a href="https://www.ucwcolorado.org/">United Campus Workers of Colorado</a>, our CU labor union. In 2020, I was elected to the Steering Committee and then elected union secretary, where I served for one year.</p>

<p>I have also been organizing on a weekly basis for over two years with <a href="https://safeboulder.org/">SAFE Boulder</a>, a direct aid and advocacy group with the houseless community.</p>
