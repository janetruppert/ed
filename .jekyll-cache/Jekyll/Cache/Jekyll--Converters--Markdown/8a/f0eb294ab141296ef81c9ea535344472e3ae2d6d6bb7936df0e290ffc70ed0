I"ä	<p>While pursuing research and education, I have also developed skills in web development, higher education, and technology evaluation. In particular, I have experience developing websites with languages such as PHP, teaching computer science through languages such as Python, and evaluating the accessibility and privacy of technologies according to given metrics.</p>

<p>As a Privacy Policy Evaluator with <a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/">Common Sense Media</a>â€™s <a href="https://privacy.commonsense.org/">Privacy Program</a>, I perform quantitative evaluations of legal policies and publish qualitative, written summaries to the programâ€™s website.</p>

<p>During my tenure as a doctoral student, I have taught the undergraduate Python computing course Computational Reasoning I over a number of semesters. In the summer of 2019, I was the courseâ€™s primary instructor for 15 graduate and undergraduate students who were completely new to coding. As the instructor, I implemented a project-based curriculum that included interactive game design and data storytelling.</p>

<p>To design and administer this curriculum, I drew on my experience teaching Python to undergraduates as a graduate teaching assistant for same course, as well as teaching Python to middle school students in a <a href="https://girlswhocode.com/">Girls Who Code club</a> I co-founded with the <a href="https://www.tuscaloosa-library.org/">Tuscaloosa Public Library</a>.</p>

<p>As an undergraduate in 2017, I joined the University of Alabamaâ€™s brand-new <a href="https://accessibility.ua.edu/">Technology Accessibility Initiative</a> as an accessibility evaluator. As part of this ambitious project to audit and and improve the accessibility of university websites according to <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/">WCAG 2.0 guidelines</a>, I personally performed over 100 manual and automated accessibility audits and organized resources to track our groupâ€™s progress.</p>

<p>This led me to subsequent opportunities through the University of Alabamaâ€™s <a href="https://oit.ua.edu/">Office of Information Technology</a>, where I was hired as a student web developer by their Office of Multimedia Services to design and update websites and later by <a href="https://housing.sa.ua.edu/">Housing and Residential Communities</a> on a special project to develop a work order submission form. To develop this updated form, I implemented Laravel, PHP, and XAMPP database tools and managed the project end-to-end.</p>
